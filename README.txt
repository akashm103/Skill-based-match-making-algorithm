# Skill-based-match-making-algorithm
the approach for the code is:
       firstly the permutation of every players is taken in and grouped into m members contaning a team such that there is no repeated team
       and it is saved in acoording to their index in vector 'ans'
       then a vector containg the index of 'ans' in 'superans' with their average 
       In Last it is printed according to differnce of average of both teams
Major use of hashing to make understanding easy and backtraking for the permutations
The test cases used are:
